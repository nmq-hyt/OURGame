                            Each player starts with 10 hp
                            Each player starts with 1 energy per round,
                            Energy must be spent by playing a card.(turn cannot be skiped even if the card played would do nothing)
                            Turn begins with drawing 1 card from there deck,
                            If the deck is empty the discard pile is shuffled and is placed on the deck spot,
                            All cards cost one energy.

                            A card is read from top down,
                            Attack: pick an opponent and deal one damage, (multi opponents can be chose when more than one attack a card)
                            Health: Regain 1 hp for each icon.
                            Draw: draw one card form the deck for each icon,
                            Energy: gain one energy for each icon on the crad.
                            Shield/defended: the card is placed in front of the player and is able to take a hit for each shield icon on the card.
                            Any damage dealt to a player with a shield will damage the shield instead. 
                            If you can still attack after a shield is broken the rest is taken by the player.
                            Once a shield card is used up (all shield on card have been damaged) the card goes to the discard pile.

                            Start of the game you draw 4 cards to start,
                            On a player you draw a card,
                            If a player runs out of cards in hand they draw 2 cards immediately,

                            Game first player can start randomly(could have a dice roll on screen to determine)
                            Hp cannot go over 10,
